    "#### First, the neighbourhoods of Toronto via postal codes will be scraped from a Wikipedia page. Second, an analysis of the venues will be performed to find out the top 5 hotspots of restaurant areas. Refugee housing data will be used to find out a few locations where the Syrian refugees live. \n",

    "#### The following factors will influence our decision of optimal location for the Syrian restaurant:\n",
    "   #### 1.  how many restaurants in the area . \n",
    "   #### 2. how many existing Syrian style restaurants in the area or their distance to the optimal location\n",
    "   #### 3. Distance of optimal location to the downtown Toronto area\n",
    "#### Therefore we will be using the following data to address these factors:\n",
    "   #### 1. Toronto postal code data scraped from Wikipedia page to make a dataframe of boroughs, neighbourhoods, latitude, and longitude\n",
    "   #### 2. Number of restaurants and their type and location in every neighborhood will be obtained using Foursquare API\n",
    "   #### 3. Coordinate of downtown Toronto will be obtained using Google coordinates of the CN tower, which is a well known tourist attraction located in downtown Toronto"
